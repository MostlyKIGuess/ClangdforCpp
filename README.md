# ClangdwithC++
This library has the include folder which will make clangd recognize the C++ headers.

- To use this you can clone it into any of your local directory and then copy this clang into the folder which might be located at :
```sh 
~/.local/share/nvim/mason/packages/clangd/clangd_17.0.3/lib/ 
```

- There you will see a clang folder, now instead of the original folder just copy the one in the repo from where you have cloned it, and WOHOO! it will start detecting headers now.

- If you have any trouble feel free to create issues. 
- I think for this you need to install clangd via Mason so there's that, I will soon be dropping dot files so you can copy that too.
